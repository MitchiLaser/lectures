    "# Locking algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs with multiple threads or processes running at the same time have a downside when it comes to the use of shared datastructures: You have to prevent that two running opponent threads or processes write at the same time to the data structure. Depending on the data structure itself it might be left in an unconsistent state or data is lost. Therefore, methods to prevent rare events that cause these issues are important to know.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's examine an example: Imagine two people are booking the last flight on an airlilne. Bot people don't know that this is the last flight, they just visited the booking website, registered for a ticket and now want to pay their order. Person A clicked first on the payment button but takes a lot of time to enter their credit card information. While person A is typing, person B clicks the same button on another computer, enters the credit card information faster thgan person A and leaves the website with a ticket. Seconds after that person A is also ready and recieves the same ticket, thus resulting in a single ticket being sold to two persons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's introduce a simple lock to this mechanism: When the ordering process starts, the website first checks if there is a lock on the ticket and if this ist't the case, it sets the lock, proceeding like the ticket belongs to this buyer. This works in most cases but under the rare occasion when person A and person B both click the button at the same time, both of their website instances register that no lock is set so they set their own value. If the lock was just a variable, then only one of the writing operations on that variable would be winning this so calles \"race condition\" and the lock would be looking consistent, but both buyers can proceed with their checkout and we have the same issue than in the previous example.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the reason why a sophisticated locking mechanis is needed to prevent race conditions. In order to operate well, we have to follow these rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. No two processes can be simultaneously in the same critical region\n",
    "2. You cannot make any assumption about the number of processes on a machine running in parallel as well as the speed of these processes\n",
    "3. No process outside its critical region should block any other process\n",
    "4. No process should wait forever to enter its critical region\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look on some locking mechanisms"
